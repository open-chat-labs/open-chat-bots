# SDK and examples for Motoko canister bots

Here you can find the base Motoko SDK for building OpenChat bots with some example bots.

Special thanks to OpenChat user Gekctek, who built an interim Mokoto SDK before this one was ready. We have used large chunks of his SDK, especially the JSON serializing/deserializing, in this SDK.

You can find his repo here:
